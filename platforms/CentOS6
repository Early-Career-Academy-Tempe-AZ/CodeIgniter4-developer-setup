CentOS6 comes with an AMP stack built in: Apache 2.x, MySQL 5.x and PHP 5.x

PHP7 needs to be installed separately.

This will be installed in /opt/lampstack-7.0.0-0

Tips
----

Installing this gives you a PHP7 environment in addition to the version of PHP
installed as part of your base platform.

Configure Apache here to use a different port than that used by your platform
default.

Configure your IDE to use the PHP executable from within lampstack-7.0.0-0

From a command prompt, you can **sh /opt/lampstack-7.0.0-0/use_lampstack**
to switch to a bash shell with PHP7 the default PHP version.

You *can* run CI4 at this point by **php -s localhost:8888 MYPROJECT/public/index.php**.
You'll probably want to user a server instead.
