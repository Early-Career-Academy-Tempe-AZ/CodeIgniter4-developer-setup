Apache
******

Apache comes built in to Linux & MacOSX, but not all of the installations 
have PHP7 integrated.

AMP stacks with PHP7
--------------------

-   https://bitnami.com/stacks/infrastructure (choose WAMP, MAMP or LAMP link to start)

Tips
----

Installing this gives you an Apache web server with PHP7 integrated, into a
folder appropriate to your platform, for instance /opt/lampstack-7.0.0-0/

Configure Apache appropriately ... LAMPSTACK/apache2/conf

Virtual Hosting
---------------

Virtual hosting will let you run multiple webapps each as their own subdomain.

In /etc/hosts, add entries for each virtual host, forinstance **127.0.0.1 ci4.local**

Edit LAMPSTACK/apache2/conf/httpd.conf -> enable virtual hosting.

Edit LAMPSTACK/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-vhost.conf -> provide a mapping for
the subdomain you setup (ci4.local) to the folder where you installed
CodeIgniter4, eg. MYSTUFF/CodeIgniter4/public
